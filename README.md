DbAccess
========

For those who like classic data access with a spice of C# 4.0 using the fastest ADO.NET and those who think that ORM tools are sometimes overwhelming, when you just want to access your data in fast way.

This is a simple library i did based on: https://github.com/robconery/massive, i did it because for me is fun and i like
to make the library a little more simple but yet i need to add a lots of stuff, but for now, if you use data access in 
your job and like to keep things simple i dare you to use this library ..You will like.
